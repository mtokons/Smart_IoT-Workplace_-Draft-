\section{Requirement Engineering}

\section{Implementation Methodology}
The implementation methodology is the method by which the projects are technically and operationally implemented in the field.

The thesis is carried out partially involving both literature study and design
science. The starting point of the theoretical frameworks is the rule-based method
engineering approach \citep{10.1007/978-3-642-19997-4_17} from which the research question
emerges. From there, we try to escalate to the theory of declarative workflows \citep{vanderAalst2009DeclarativeSupport} and the goal-driven approach \citep{Lamsweerde2009RequirementsSpecifications}.
