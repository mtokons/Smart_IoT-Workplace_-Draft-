\chapter{Discussion}
\textbf{This section should have a summary of the whole project.  The original aims and objective and whether these have been met should be discussed. It should include a section with a critique and a list of limitations of your proposed solutions.  Future work should be described, and this should not be marginal or silly (e.g.\ add machine learning models).  It is always good to end on a positive note (i.e.\ `Final Remarks').}


\section{Scope and limitation of the study}
In order to  familiarize the reader  regarding the scope of this research paper we have defined the limitation of the research. We have noted the scope of our study in the following texts.

In  the theory part we have discussed the issues concerning stress from various dimensions like stress in the form of emotions as well as the internal and external factors of stress. We believe that the theories we have chosen are highly relevant and make broad sense to the thesis topic and research  question.  And  in  the  empirical  findings  we  conducted  ourresearch  with  employees who  belong  to  several  departmentsat  Volvo  trucks  AB  Umea.The  respondents  who participated in our research do not represent the whole population of the organization.
